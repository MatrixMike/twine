//! Function and procedure types for Scheme
//!
//! This module will contain the procedure system for Scheme functions,
//! including built-in procedures and user-defined lambdas.
//! Currently a placeholder - will be implemented in Phase 3.

/// Placeholder for Scheme procedure types
///
/// This will be expanded in Phase 3 to include:
/// - Built-in procedures (arithmetic, list operations, I/O)
/// - User-defined lambda procedures with closures
/// - Procedure application and evaluation
pub struct Procedure {
    // Placeholder - will be implemented later
}

impl Procedure {
    /// Placeholder constructor
    pub fn placeholder() -> Self {
        Procedure {}
    }
}
