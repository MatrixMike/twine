      Scheme with fiber-based concurrency and async I/O
    </strong>
  </p>
</div>

## Overview

Twine is a [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) interpreter implementing:

- **Fiber-based Concurrency**: Lightweight fiber scheduler with multi-threaded parallel execution
- **Asynchronous I/O**: All I/O operations are async with fiber yielding
- **Strict Immutability**: All data structures are immutable after creation
- **Minimalism**: Essential language features only

## Educational Goals

This project serves as a comprehensive learning platform for understanding AI agent development workflows, interpreter design, and modern systems programming concepts.

- **AI Agent Development**: Learning to work with AI coding agents
- **Interpreter Implementation**: Understanding lexing, parsing, evaluation, and runtime systems
- **Async I/O and Parallelism**: Hands-on experience with Rust's async ecosystem
- **Concurrency Models**: Implementing fiber-based scheduling and multi-threaded execution
- **Functional Programming**: Exploring Scheme and immutable data structures

## Current Features

### âœ… Implemented
- **Lexical Analysis**: Complete tokenization with position tracking for numbers, strings, symbols, booleans, and delimiters
- **Syntactic Analysis**: Recursive descent parser for S-expressions, atoms, lists, and quoted expressions
- **Immutable Data Types**: Numbers, booleans, strings, symbols, and lists with reference counting
- **Environment Management**: Lexical scoping with identifier binding and closure support
- **Basic Evaluation Engine**: Expression evaluation with special forms and procedure application
- **Function System**: Lambda procedures with lexical closures and tail call optimization
- **Built-in Procedures**: Arithmetic operations, comparisons, and list operations
- **Special Forms**: `define`, `lambda`, `let`, `if`, and `quote`
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive syntax error reporting with precise position information
- **Test Coverage**: 295+ tests covering all implemented features

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Interactive REPL implementation
- File execution capabilities

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- Interactive REPL and file execution
- Fiber scheduler with automatic I/O yielding
- Two-layer concurrency: low-level fibers and high-level async tasks
- R7RS-small macro system
- Lexical scoping with closures
- Built-in arithmetic, list operations, and conditionals

## Quick Start

```scheme
;; Basic arithmetic and functions
(define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))
(square 5)  ; => 25

;; List operations
(define numbers '(1 2 3 4 5))
(map square numbers)  ; => (1 4 9 16 25)

;; Async tasks with fiber concurrency
(define task1 (async (+ 1 2)))
(define task2 (async (* 3 4)))
(+ (task-wait task1) (task-wait task2))  ; => 15

;; Macros for code transformation
(define-syntax when
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((when condition body ...)
     (if condition (begin body ...)))))
(when #t (display "Hello World"))
```

## Architecture

Twine uses a fiber scheduler built on `smol`, allowing multiple fibers to execute concurrently across CPU cores. The codebase is organized into modules that reflect interpreter concepts:

- `lexer/` - Input tokenization with position tracking and error reporting
- `parser/` - S-expression parsing and AST construction
- `types/` - Immutable Scheme data types
- `interpreter/` - Core evaluation engine and environment management
- `runtime/` - Fiber scheduler, task system, and async I/O
- `repl/` - Interactive interface
